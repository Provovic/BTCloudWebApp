<h4>How to use:</h4>
<p>
    The file will be uploaded to the server, where a securely generated time-based link will be sent to 
    the specified email address. This link will expire after 30 minutes. If you receive a web page that 
    displays an XML-Authentication Failed page, then the link has expired, and you'll need to resend the 
    file.

<h4>Technical Details:</h4>
<p>
    This is a straightforward file-sharing application that enables users to upload files 
    and send them to an email address. The application is developed using ASP.NET Core, C#, 
    and Python. Uploaded files are stored in an Azure Storage Container for a limited time (currently 30 minutes). 
    A SAS Token and URL for the file are generated by an Azure Blob Trigger, written in Python, 
    and then sent to the specified email address using the SendGrid Email API. The link is only 
    valid for a limited time, ensuring security through encryption to safeguard both the file 
    and the link. With its user-friendly interface, this application offers a convenient solution 
    for sharing files with others.
