<h5>How to use:</h5>
<p>
    Please select a file from your device to upload and enter the email address to which you'd like to send it. 
    The file will be uploaded to the server, a securely generated link will be created, and an email will be sent 
    to the specified address.
</p>

<h5>Details:</h5>
<p>
    This is a straightforward file-sharing application that enables users to upload files and send them to an email address. 
    The application is developed using ASP.NET Core, C#, and Python. Uploaded files are stored in an Azure Storage Container 
    for a limited time (currently 30 minutes). A SAS Token and URL for the file are generated by an Azure Blob Trigger, written 
    in Python, and then sent to the specified email address using the SendGrid Email API. The link is only valid for a limited 
    time and can be accessed solely by the recipient. The application ensures security through encryption to safeguard both the 
    file and the link. With its user-friendly interface, this application offers a convenient solution for sharing files with 
    others.
