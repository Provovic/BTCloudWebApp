    <p>I've developed an ASP.NET 8.0 Web App hosted on Azure App Services. 
        The site is equipped with a robust CI/CD Pipeline that automates the build, testing, 
        and deployment processes, streamlining the development workflow. 
        This setup ensures efficiency and reliability in managing the codebase.</p>
